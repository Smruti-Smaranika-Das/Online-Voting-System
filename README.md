 Project Category :
The project is categorized as an Internet-based Application Development initiative. Influencing the flow of technologies in India and taking a step towards digital India.

Objectives 
There are a few objectives asserted in this project. These are mentioned as follows : 
●	To create a secure online platform where voters can cast their votes conveniently: Security remains the major concern when it comes to others so it provides a secure environment for the voters to cast their votes with their data being safe from exploitation. It provides convenience by having your personal space and environment.
●	To ensure the system is resistant to unauthorized access and fraud: By using a two-factor authentication it prevents unverified bypass. It uses email verification which prevents fraudsters from gaining unwanted access.
●	To facilitate real-time vote counting and result announcement: It counts the votes in real-time and shows it to the administrator who can keep monitoring the live feed of the votes being cast and announce the result as soon as voting ends which saves time and gives accurate results by relying on the computer.
●	To improve voter turnout by making voting accessible from any location: There are times when some people cannot vote due to many reasons such as - geological reasons, emergencies, personal factors, etc. It counters that factor by providing accessibility anywhere anytime which can result in a rise in votes with time. 
●	To empower digital India: It shows that India as a developing country is ready to take its digitalization in software and technologies to further integration by implementing a centralized system for a government voting system for India.
